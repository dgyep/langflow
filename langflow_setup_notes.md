# Langflow Setup Notes

## Environment
- Windows environment with Python 3.13
- Visual C++ Build Tools 2022 installed
- Rust installed

## Installation Attempts

### What worked:
- Successfully installed core dependencies (numpy, pandas, scipy, tokenizers)
- Successfully installed langflow package (minimal version)
- Successfully installed langchain and related packages
- Successfully installed FastAPI and uvicorn

### Challenges encountered:
- Compilation issues with C++ extensions
- Rust dependency requirements for tokenizers
- Missing langflow.__main__ module
- Multiple dependency conflicts (ibm-watsonx-ai, etc.)

## Recommended Installation Approach

For a working Langflow installation:

1. Use Python 3.9-3.11 instead of 3.13 (more compatible with dependencies)
2. Create a fresh virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv .venv-py39
   .\.venv-py39\Scripts\activate
   ```
   
3. Install with specific version constraints:
   ```
   pip install "langflow==0.6.7"
   ```
   
   Or try a minimal installation approach:
   ```
   pip install "langflow[minimal]"  # If this option exists
   ```

## Running Langflow

After installation:
```
python -m langflow run
```

## Additional Notes

Consider using conda/mamba for more reliable dependency resolution if pip continues to have issues.
