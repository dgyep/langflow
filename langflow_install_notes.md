# Langflow Installation Documentation

## Installation Journey Summary

### Initial Environment

- Windows environment with Python 3.13
- Repository: https://github.com/dgyep/langflow.git cloned to c:\Users\deang\Documents\Projects\ai_sandbox_examples\langflow

### First Attempt (with Python 3.13)

#### Environment Setup

- Installed Visual C++ Build Tools 2022 for C++ compilation
- Installed Rust for tokenizers and other dependencies
- Created virtual environment with Python 3.13
- Created build_env.bat to set up environment variables

#### Dependency Modifications

- Modified dependencies in pyproject.toml:
  - Changed crewai from 0.102.0 to 0.86.0
  - Changed ibm-watsonx-ai from >=1.3.1 to 1.1.16
  - Changed langchain-ibm from >=0.3.8 to 0.3.5
  - Changed langchain-pinecone from 0.2.3 to 0.2.5
  - Changed ragstack-ai-knowledge-store from 0.2.1 to 0.0.6

#### Installation Attempts

- Installed core dependencies manually (numpy, pandas, scipy, tokenizers)
- Tried installing langflow with --no-deps
- Encountered error: "No module named 'langflow.main'" when trying to run
- Attempted to install langflow-base but hit version conflicts

#### Version Conflicts

- Key blocker: ibm-watsonx-ai required version >=1.3.1 but only 1.1.16 was available on PyPI
- Found version 1.3.3 on PyPI but couldn't install due to Python version restriction
- Error: Package 'ibm-watsonx-ai' requires a different Python: 3.13.0 not in '<3.13,>=3.10'

### Second Attempt (with Python 3.12)

#### New Environment

- Installed Python 3.12 (to meet ibm-watsonx-ai requirement of >=3.10,<3.13)
- Created new virtual environment with Python 3.12: .venv-py312
- Upgraded pip, wheel, and setuptools

#### Standard Installation

- Attempted standard installation: pip install langflow
- Extended dependency resolution process began (200k+ combinations tried)
- Encountered error: ResolutionTooDeep: 200000
- Pip resolver couldn't find compatible versions after 200,000 attempts

### Current Status

- Dependencies: Extremely complex dependency tree with many version conflicts
- Environment: Python 3.12 virtual environment set up and ready
- Main Issue: Pip resolver unable to resolve all dependencies simultaneously
- Working Components: Visual C++ and Rust toolchains installed correctly

### Recommended Next Steps (In Priority Order)

1. Staged Installation Approach

```powershell
# Install core langflow without dependencies
pip install langflow --no-deps

# Install dependencies in strategic batches
pip install pydantic langchain-core langchain
pip install fastapi uvicorn
pip install langchain-community~=0.3.10
# Continue with other dependency groups
```

2. Try a More Stable Version

```powershell
# Install specific older version
pip install langflow==0.6.7
```

3. Use Alternative Environment Management

```powershell
# Create conda environment (better dependency resolver)
conda create -n langflow-env python=3.12
conda activate langflow-env
pip install langflow
```

4. Simplified Installation

```powershell
# Install from source (development mode)
# Already in the right directory
pip install -e .
```

### Testing After Installation

After successful installation:

```powershell
python -m langflow run
```

This should start the langflow server, which can be accessed at http://localhost:7860

### Troubleshooting Notes

When encountering C++ build errors, ensure Visual C++ build tools are properly configured
For Rust-dependent packages, ensure Rust is in the PATH
Consider creating a constraints.txt file to pin specific working versions
The complexity of langflow's dependency tree makes installation challenging; patience is required during resolution
Would you like me to explain any specific section of this documentation in more detail? Or would you prefer to focus on implementing one of the recommended solutions?
